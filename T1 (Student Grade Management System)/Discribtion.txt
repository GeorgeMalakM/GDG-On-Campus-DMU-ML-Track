Project Title: Student Grade Management System
Objective:
Build a simple Python-based system where users can:

Add students and their grades.

Calculate averages, highest/lowest grades, and performance levels.

Use functions, loops, conditionals, and data structures effectively.

Phase 1: Collecting and Storing Data
Concepts Covered:
✅ Variables, Data Types, User Input, Lists, Dictionaries

Tasks:
Ask the user to enter student names and their grades.

Store the data in a dictionary, where the student’s name is the key and the grade is the value.

Allow multiple entries until the user types "done".

Example Interaction:


Enter student name (or type 'done' to finish): Ali
Enter Ali's grade: 85
Enter student name (or type 'done' to finish): Mona
Enter Mona's grade: 92
Enter student name (or type 'done' to finish): Omar
Enter Omar's grade: 76
Enter student name (or type 'done' to finish): done
Phase 2: Processing Data & Calculating Results
Concepts Covered:
✅ Operators, Loops, Conditionals, Functions

Tasks:
Create a function to calculate:

The class average grade.

The highest and lowest grades.

The top-performing student.

Determine performance levels based on grades:

90-100: Excellent

75-89: Good

Below 75: Needs Improvement

Phase 3: Displaying Results in a Report
Concepts Covered:
✅ Print Statements, String Formatting

Tasks:
Print the results clearly with section titles.

Format output properly (aligned text, structured layout).

Example Output:


Class Performance Report
-------------------------
Total Students: 3
Average Grade: 84.33
Highest Grade: 92 (Mona)
Lowest Grade: 76 (Omar)
Performance Breakdown:
Ali - 85 (Good)
Mona - 92 (Excellent)
Omar - 76 (Good)
Submission Requirements:
Handles invalid inputs, ensuring grades are numeric.
