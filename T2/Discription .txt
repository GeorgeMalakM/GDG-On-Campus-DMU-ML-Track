Project Title: Retail Sales Data Analysis System

Objective:

Build a simple Python system where users can:
✅ Load sales data from a CSV file.
✅ Calculate key metrics like total revenue, average sale, highest/lowest sale, and best-selling product using pandas and NumPy.

Phase 1: Collecting and Storing Data

Concepts Covered:
✅ File Handling, DataFrames, Basic Data Cleaning

Tasks:

Ask the user to enter the file path of a sales CSV file.

Load the CSV into a pandas DataFrame.

Display a short summary (e.g., number of transactions).

Example Interaction:

Enter the path to your sales data file: sales_data.csv
Loading data...
Data loaded! Total transactions: 1000

Phase 2: Processing Data & Calculating Results

Concepts Covered:
✅ NumPy Operations, Data Aggregation, Basic Statistics

Tasks:

Create functions to calculate:

Total Revenue

Average Sale per Transaction

Highest and Lowest Sales

Best-Selling Product

Phase 3: Displaying Results in a Report

Concepts Covered:
✅ Print Statements, String Formatting

Tasks:

Print a clear report with section titles.

Format the output to show:

Total transactions

Total revenue

Average sale

Highest and lowest sales

Best-selling product

Example Output:

Retail Sales Report
----------------------------
Total Transactions: 1000
Total Revenue: $250,000
Average Sale: $250
Highest Sale: $5,000 (Product: Laptop)
Lowest Sale: $5 (Product: Notebook)
Best-Selling Product: Widget A

Submission Requirements:

A single .py file with clear comments.

The CSV file should be included in the repository.

The program must handle missing or incorrect data gracefully.

Upload the project to a GitHub repo and share the link.
